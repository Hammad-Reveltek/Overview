What is BIM?
BIM is a building information modeling and it's core a holistic process of creating and managing data Within an intelligent 3D model to build and operate. 
It's the foundation for digital transformation in the Architectral engineering and construction engineering.
BIM consist of four components plan , Design , Build , Operate. 
BIM is use to describe the process of creating virtual model that represent actual building services. 
In BIM if you only have a 3D model without any details then it means it's not a BIM model because BIM includes all information about the project like electrical , 
plumbing and mechnical , lighting , analysis , estimation and without these information BIM model is not a BIM project.
